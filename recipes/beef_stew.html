    <h1> Beef Stew </h1>

    <img src="../images/beef_stew.jpg" alt="Picture of Beef Stew" height="300" width="400">
    <p> Beef stew starts with searing chunks of beef until they develop a deep, caramelized crust.
        Onions, garlic, and herbs are added to the pot, releasing their fragrance as they soften.
        Carrots, potatoes, and other hearty vegetables join in,
        soaking up the flavors as everything simmers slowly in a rich broth.
        Over time, the sauce thickens, the beef turns tender enough to fall apart with a spoon,
        and the kitchen fills with warmth. A bowl of beef stew is comfort in its purest form, 
        perfect for cold evenings or when you want a meal that feels like home. </p>
