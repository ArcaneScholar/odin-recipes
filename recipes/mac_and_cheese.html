    <h1> Mac and Cheese </h1>
    <img src="../images/mac_and_cheese.jpg" alt="Picture of Mac and Cheese" height="300" width="400">
    <p> Mac and cheese is the definition of creamy comfort. Elbow pasta is cooked until tender,
        then folded into a smooth cheese sauce made with butter, milk, and a generous amount of melted cheddar.
        The sauce clings to every piece, turning a simple dish into something rich and satisfying.
        Baked with a golden breadcrumb crust or served straight from the pot,
        mac and cheese is a classic that never fails to bring warmth to the table.</p>
